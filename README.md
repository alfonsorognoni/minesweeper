# # Minesweeper
Minimal Minesweeper for darwoft challenge :)

## Run options

You can run `yarn add` to install dependencies, then if you run `yarn dev` start a local server with live reload, and if you run `yarn build` the code is compile to production.
If you need install yarn follow this [link](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

## Notes to reviewers
I used parcel.js to have a fast development environment without special configuration. Link [parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/)
